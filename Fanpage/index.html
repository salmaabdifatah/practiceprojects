            Hamilton is the award-winning musical by <i><b> Lin-Manuel Miranda. </b></i> <br>
            Since its release in 2015, it has received acclaim through it's unique use of R&B and Hip-Hop to tell the story of Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton. <br><br> It features an almost-exclusive cast of black and brown actors and as stated by Lin: <br> <q><b>So much of what Hamilton is about is how history remembers, and how that changes over time. It takes on a different meaning when you see Black and Brown performers telling the origin story of our country</b></q> <br><br>
            The musical received a record-breaking 16 nominations at the Tony Awards and won 11 awards, including <i> Best Musical </i>. <br> Aside from its Broadway run, it has gone on to produce several companies that have performed across the US as well as the West End. And it released the film version of the original cast on Disney+ in 2020.

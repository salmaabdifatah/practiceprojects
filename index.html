        <h2>About Hamilton
          <section>
            Hamilton is the ground breaking musical written by <em> Lin-Manuel Miranda. </em>
            It opened in 2015 and became an instant hit. 
            The show now holds residencies across the world including the West End. 

            My three favourite songs are:

            <ol>
              <li> Wait for it</li>
              <li> Helpless</li>
              <li> Satisfied</li>
            </ol>
